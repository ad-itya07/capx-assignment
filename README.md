# Frontend - Portfolio Tracker

This folder contains the frontend code for the Portfolio Tracker application. It is built using React.js and Material-UI for a responsive and intuitive UI.

---

## Steps to Run the Frontend Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ad-itya07/capx-assignment.git

# 2. Install Dependencies
npm install

# 3. Start the Frontend Development Server
npm start
```
# Set Up Environment Variables
   **REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL** https://capx-assignment.onrender.com/api/stocks

# Access the Application
   **Open your browser and go to**:
      https://capx-frontend-8nfd.vercel.app/
      
## Assumptions and Limitations:
   # 1. Backend Dependency:
         The frontend relies on the backend to provide API endpoints. Ensure the backend is running or the deployed backend is accessible.

   # 2. Material-UI for Styling:
         The application uses Material-UI components to deliver a professional, responsive design.

   # 3. Error Handling:
         If an invalid or incorrect stock ticker is added, the frontend displays the error message returned by the backend.
